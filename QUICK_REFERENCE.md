## 💡 One-Liner Summary

**Run the SQL, test with 500 users, deploy if pass, warm up before event. Done!**

---

## ✅ Minimum Viable Checklist

- [ ] SQL index created (2 min)
- [ ] Load test passed with 100 users (5 min)
- [ ] Code deployed (3 min)

**That's it! These 3 things will get you 80% of the benefit.**

For the full 100%, follow `PRE_EVENT_CHECKLIST.md`

## 📞 Quick Help

**Problem**: Load test fails  
**Fix**: Check database index with verification query in SQL file

**Problem**: Can't get test token  
**Fix**: Any invalid token will test the system load (just won't return data)

**Problem**: Warmup shows errors  
**Fix**: Normal! As long as HTTP status < 500, functions are warming
